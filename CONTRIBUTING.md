**AstroTogether** comments and contributions are always welcome.  Just note that a few simple rules need to be followed when submitting pull-requests:

* Be sure to include a copy of the standard license header in each of the new or updated source code files you submit
* No changes to the solution-wide .editorconfig file will be accepted
* Pull-requests will not be accepted without full-coverage unit-tests for the new or updated functionality
 
NOTE: the basic mission of AstroTogther is to facilitate the **creation and management of ad-hoc observing events**.  As such, a pull-request for weather-alerts would be slam-dunk great, but the ASCOM control of a telescope would be totally out of scope (tee hee).  If you have questions in this regard, please use <a href="https://github.com/squideyes/AstroTogether/issues" target="_blank">GitHub Issues</a>.  For that matter, there's a bunch of items on the backlog that we could really use some help on.
